# The only issue with native GMod
For some unknown reason, certain addons may cause FPS drops when you join a server. Unfortunately, there’s no permanent solution to this issue.

Switching your resolution from fullscreen to borderless (or vice versa) can temporarily restore normal FPS. 
However, you’ll need to repeat this process each time you connect to a server with such addons. 
For example, the Modern Warfare Base Weapons addon causes FPS drops for me (But not for my friend, that's weird).
